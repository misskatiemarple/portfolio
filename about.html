      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Front-end developer from England</h3>
      <div class="about-paragraphs">
        <p>
          With a background in youth work, teaching, and a personal passion for
          education, becoming a teacher was a natural progression. I focus on
          educating in a way that encourages younger students to use the target
          language through a fun learning process.
          <br />
          Meanwhile, adults can enjoy sharing their experiences, and business
          employees can tackle advanced terminology to identify different
          nuances. I have lived in over five countries but chose to settle in
          Japan.
          <br />
          In total, I have lived here for three years. I want to continue
          teaching in Japan, not just because education is my passion, but
          because I feel that Japanese students gain the most from my classes.
          For example, through my own studies of the Japanese language, I can
          identify the ‚Äútroublesome spots‚Äù that students struggle with. This
          includes both grammar and pronunciation.
          <br />
          Therefore, I am grateful that I can use my secondary passion, the
          Japanese language, to support the development of English classes. This
          unique insight is only possible while teaching in Japan. Finally, it
          is important that Japanese students are able to actively participate
          in the global community.
          <br />
          The ability to speak English naturally will open up more doors for
          them and can even lead to future careers. I am naturally a bright and
          personable teacher. I‚Äôve heard from many students that they enjoy my
          classes and this encourages them to study harder. I am truly excited
          about this job opportunity.
          <br />
          I plan to move to Okayama in the New Year, but I am flexible. I thank
          you for taking the time to read my cover letter and I look forward to
          answering any questions you have.
